# Useful-Tools
Scripts and tools I use all the time.

Inspect.exe - Used for viewing windows API object control identifiers, among other things.

SWAPY32bit.exe - Used for viewing windows API object control identifiers, among other things. Generates the code you request, but isn't always accurate.

addDV.py - A script to add dvorak on windows 10(using pywinauto). Other layouts can be chosen depending on number of keystrokes for down or tab.

removeDV.py - A script to remove dvorak on windows 10(using pywinauto). Can also be altered to choose layout depending on number of keystrokes for down or tab.

DirCopy.py - Used to recreate a folder structure and move selected files to said folder structure based on a csv within the same dir as this script.
